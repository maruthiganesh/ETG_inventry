Inventry management
Initially data is set into txt file.
Later, when we run the program, user is requested for items needed. 
If the user asks for quantity more than available, then it show indication that stock unavailable.
The details of quantity are also taken for each and every input.
Later total amount is printed as bill.
The items will be deducted from the inventory and the txt file is updated with the new list.
